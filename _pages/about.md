Hi, I'm Keenan. I'm a graduate student in the [Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analysis Laboratory](https://sites.uw.edu/rsgal/) at the University of Washington. Here, I use satellites and laser scanners to study the temperature of forest canopies. I write lots of code, especially in R and Google Earth Engine. Prior to coming to UW, I worked in the [Global Water Lab](http://aquatics-lab.weebly.com/) and at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I also wrote (and won!) an NSF GRFP. Feel free to contact me below.

This site contains useful code tricks and some snippets of my current projects.
