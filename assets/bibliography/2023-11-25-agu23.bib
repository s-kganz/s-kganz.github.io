  abstract = {Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

  abstract = {Hemispherical photography is a relevant tool to estimate canopy attributes such as leaf area index (LAI). Advancements in digital photography and image processing tools have supported long-lasting use of digital hemispherical photography (DHP). While some open-source tools exists for DHP, very few solutions have been made available in R programming packages, and none of these allows a full processing workflow to retrieve LAI and other canopy attributes from fisheye images. To fill this gap, we developed an R package (hemispheR) to support the whole processing of DHP images in an automated, fast, and reproducible way. The package functions, which are designed for step-by-step single-image analysis, can be performed sequentially in a pipeline, while allowing inspecting the quality of each image processing step. The package allows to analyze both circular and fullframe fisheye images, collected either with upward facing (forest canopies) or downward facing (short canopies and crops) camera orientation. In addition, the package allows to implement two consolidated LAI methods (LAI-2000/2200 and 57{\textdegree} method). A case study is presented to demonstrate the reliability of canopy attributes derived from hemispheR in temperate deciduous forests with variable canopy density and structure. Canopy attributes were validated against either results obtained from a reference proprietary software, either by benchmarking plot-level LAI with measurements obtained from littertraps. Results indicated hemispheR provide reliable openness and leaf area index in forest canopies as compared with reference values. We also found that combining hemispheR with other R packages further advance analysis of hemispherical canopy images, by reducing the sensitivity of results to camera exposure in both raw and non-raw canopy imagery. By providing a simple, transparent, and flexible image processing procedure, hemispheR supported the use of DHP for routine measurements and monitoring of forest canopy attributes. Hosting the package in a Git repository can further support development of the package, through either collaborative coding or forking projects.},

  abstract = {Evapotranspiration regulates energy flux partitioning at the leaf surface, which in turn regulates leaf temperature. However, the mechanistic relationship between evapotranspiration and leaf temperature remains poorly constrained. In this study, we present a novel mechanistic model to predict leaf temperature as a linearized function of the evaporative fraction. The model is validated using measurements from infrared radiometers mounted on two flux towers in Arizona, USA, which measure canopies of Prosopis velutina with contrasting water availability. Both the observations and model predictions reveal that leaf temperature equilibrates with air temperature when latent heat flux consumes all of the energy incident on the leaf surface. Leaf temperature exceeds air temperature when there is a net input of energy into the leaf tissue. The flux tower observations revealed that evaporative cooling reduced canopy leaf temperature by ca. 1{\textendash}5 {\textdegree}C, depending on water availability. Evaporative cooling also enhanced net carbon uptake by reducing leaf respiration by ca. 15\% in the middle of the growing season. The regulation of leaf temperature by evapotranspiration and the resulting impact on net carbon uptake represents an important link between plant water and carbon cycles that has received little attention in literature. The model presented here provides a mechanistic framework to quantify leaf evaporative cooling and examine its impacts on plant physiological function.},

This study evaluated the accuracy of TIR measurements of a conifer tree that were made using the thermal camera's factory default settings, and developed a post-collection data processing method to correct measurements for ambient conditions that depart from the factory default settings. We conducted a 42-day measurement campaign in Corvallis, Oregon during spring 2014 that focused on the canopy temperature of a noble fir (Abies procera) and included the simultaneous collection of meteorological data and leaf temperature measurements with an array of thermocouples. We then developed empirical functions for temperature corrections that better accounted for emissivity, and atmospheric and reflected temperature. The original TIR temperatures using the factory settings averaged 8.6{$\pm$}5.6{\textdegree}C (-4.2 to 25.4{\textdegree}C in range), and the original TIR temperatures differed from the thermocouple temperatures by 1.4{\textendash}1.6K. The TIR temperatures were generally accurate, except for a low temperature bias at leaf temperatures below 5{\textdegree}C. TIR temperature corrections reduced this bias to a {$<$}1.0K mean error relative to the thermocouples. Our results show that TIR measurements can be corrected to more accurately quantify canopy temperature, and that the importance of this correction increases under more extreme ambient conditions, such as colder periods.},

  abstract = {We present the R package bigleaf (version 0.6.5), an open source toolset for the derivation of meteorological, aerodynamic, and physiological ecosystem properties from eddy covariance (EC) flux observations and concurrent meteorological measurements. A `big-leaf' framework, in which vegetation is represented as a single, uniform layer, is employed to infer bulk ecosystem characteristics top-down from the measured fluxes. Central to the package is the calculation of a bulk surface/canopy conductance (Gs/Gc) and a bulk aerodynamic conductance (Ga), with the latter including formulations for the turbulent and canopy boundary layer components. The derivation of physical land surface characteristics such as surface roughness parameters, wind profile, aerodynamic and radiometric surface temperature, surface vapor pressure deficit (VPD), potential evapotranspiration (ET), imposed and equilibrium ET, as well as vegetation-atmosphere decoupling coefficients, is described. The package further provides calculation routines for physiological ecosytem properties (stomatal slope parameters, stomatal sensitivity to VPD, bulk intercellular CO2 concentration, canopy photosynthetic capacity), energy balance characteristics (closure, biochemical energy), ancillary meteorological variables (psychrometric constant, saturation vapor pressure, air density, etc.), customary unit interconversions and data filtering. The target variables can be calculated with a different degree of complexity, depending on the amount of available site-specific information. The utilities of the package are demonstrated for three single-level (above-canopy) eddy covariance sites representing a temperate grassland, a temperate needle-leaf forest, and a Mediterranean evergreen broadleaf forest. The routines are further tested for a two-level EC site (tree and grass layer) located in a Mediterranean oak savanna. The limitations and the ecophysiological interpretation of the derived ecosystem properties are discussed and practical guidelines are given. The package provides the basis for a consistent, physically sound, and reproducible characterization of biometeorological conditions and ecosystem physiology, and is applicable to EC sites across vegetation types and climatic conditions with minimal ancillary data requirements.},

  abstract = {Airborne laser scanning (ALS) is a remote sensing technology known for its applicability in natural resources management. By quantifying the three-dimensional structure of vegetation and underlying terrain using laser technology, ALS has been used extensively for enhancing geospatial knowledge in the fields of forestry and ecology. Structural descriptions of vegetation provide a means of estimating a range of ecologically pertinent attributes, such as height, volume, and above-ground biomass. The efficient processing of large, often technically complex datasets requires dedicated algorithms and software. The continued promise of ALS as a tool for improving ecological understanding is often dependent on user-created tools, methods, and approaches. Due to the proliferation of ALS among academic, governmental, and private-sector communities, paired with requirements to address a growing demand for open and accessible data, the ALS community is recognising the importance of free and open-source software (FOSS) and the importance of user-defined workflows. Herein, we describe the philosophy behind the development of the lidR package. Implemented in the R environment with a C/C++ backend, lidR is free, open-source and cross-platform software created to enable simple and creative processing workflows for forestry and ecology communities using ALS data. We review current algorithms used by the research community, and in doing so raise awareness of current successes and challenges associated with parameterisation and common implementation approaches. Through a detailed description of the package, we address the key considerations and the design philosophy that enables users to implement user-defined tools. We also discuss algorithm choices that make the package representative of the `state-of-the-art' and we highlight some internal limitations through examples of processing time discrepancies. We conclude that the development of applications like lidR are of fundamental importance for developing transparent, flexible and open ALS tools to ensure not only reproducible workflows, but also to offer researchers the creative space required for the progress and development of the discipline.},

Using a statistical model, these factors predicted biomass growth across tree size classes in forest near Manaus, Brazil. The same statistical model, with no parameterisation change but driven by different observed canopy structure, predicted the higher productivity of a site 500 km east. Gap fraction and a metric of vegetation vertical extent and evenness also predicted biomass gains and losses for one-hectare plots. Despite significant site differences in canopy structure and carbon dynamics, the relation between biomass growth and light fell on a unifying curve. This supported our hypothesis, suggesting that knowledge of canopy structure can explain variation in biomass growth over tropical landscapes and improve understanding of ecosystem function.},

  abstract = {Understanding and predicting the relationship between leaf temperature (                                T                 leaf                              ) and air temperature (                                T                 air                              ) is essential for projecting responses to a warming climate, as studies suggest that many forests are near thermal thresholds for carbon uptake. Based on leaf measurements, the limited leaf homeothermy hypothesis argues that daytime                                T                 leaf                              is maintained near photosynthetic temperature optima and below damaging temperature thresholds. Specifically, leaves should cool below                                T                 air                              at higher temperatures (i.e., {$>$} {$\sim$}25{\textendash}30{\textdegree}C) leading to slopes {$<$}1 in                                T                 leaf                              /                                T                 air                              relationships and substantial carbon uptake when leaves are cooler than air. This hypothesis implies that climate warming will be mitigated by a compensatory leaf cooling response. A key uncertainty is understanding whether such thermoregulatory behavior occurs in natural forest canopies. We present an unprecedented set of growing season canopy-level leaf temperature (                                T                 can                              ) data measured with thermal imaging at multiple well-instrumented forest sites in North and Central America. Our data do not support the limited homeothermy hypothesis: canopy leaves are warmer than air during most of the day and only cool below air in mid to late afternoon, leading to                                T                 can                              /                                T                 air                              slopes {$>$}1 and hysteretic behavior. We find that the majority of ecosystem photosynthesis occurs when canopy leaves are warmer than air. Using energy balance and physiological modeling, we show that key leaf traits influence leaf-air coupling and ultimately the                                T                 can                              /                                T                 air                              relationship. Canopy structure also plays an important role in                                T                 can                              dynamics. Future climate warming is likely to lead to even greater                                T                 can                              , with attendant impacts on forest carbon cycling and mortality risk.},

The surface temperature of organisms is often more relevant for ecological processes than air temperature, which is much more commonly measured. Surface temperature influences{\textemdash}and is influenced by{\textemdash}a range of biological, physical, and chemical processes, providing a unique view of temperature effects on ecosystem function. Furthermore, surface temperatures vary markedly over a range of temporal and spatial scales and may diverge from air temperature by 40{\textdegree}C or more. Surface temperature measurements have been challenging due to sensor and computational limitations but are now feasible at high spatial and temporal resolutions using thermal imaging. Thus, significant advances in our understanding of plant and ecosystem thermal regimes and their functional consequences are now possible. Thermal measurements may be used to address many ecological questions, such as the thermal controls on plant and ecosystem metabolism and the impact of heat waves and drought. Further advances in this area will require interdisciplinary collaborations among practitioners in fields ranging from physiology to ecosystem ecology to remote sensing and geospatial analysis. In this overview, we demonstrate the feasibility, utility, and potential of thermal imaging for measuring vegetation surface temperatures across a range of scales and from measurement, analysis, and synthesis perspectives.},

  abstract = {Rising temperatures are influencing forests on many scales, with potentially strong variation vertically across forest strata. Using published research and new analyses, we evaluate how microclimate and leaf temperatures, traits, and gas exchange vary vertically in forests, shaping tree, and ecosystem ecology. In closed-canopy forests, upper canopy leaves are exposed to the highest solar radiation and evaporative demand, which can elevate leaf temperature (Tleaf), particularly when transpirational cooling is curtailed by limited stomatal conductance. However, foliar traits also vary across height or light gradients, partially mitigating and protecting against the elevation of upper canopy Tleaf. Leaf metabolism generally increases with height across the vertical gradient, yet differences in thermal sensitivity across the gradient appear modest. Scaling from leaves to trees, canopy trees have higher absolute metabolic capacity and growth, yet are more vulnerable to drought and damaging Tleaf than their smaller counterparts, particularly under climate change. By contrast, understory trees experience fewer extreme high Tleaf's but have fewer cooling mechanisms and thus may be strongly impacted by warming under some conditions, particularly when exposed to a harsher microenvironment through canopy disturbance. As the climate changes, integrating the patterns and mechanisms reviewed here into models will be critical to forecasting forest{\textendash}climate feedback.},
